## New contributor guide

See the [README](README.md) to get an overview of the project. Here are some helpful resources to get you comfortable with open source contribution:

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with anything, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue
Same goes for new features, look for a pre-existing feature request, if there's none, create a new issue with the label "feature-request"

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters.
